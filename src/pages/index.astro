        I design and build secure, scalable, and automated cloud platforms using
        <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, <strong>Terraform</strong>, and
        modern <strong>DevSecOps</strong> practices.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        With a strong full-stack background, I bridge application development
        with cloud architecture to deliver fast, reliable, and cost-efficient
        systems. I currently lead Cloud &amp; DevOps initiatives at
        <strong>Day Truck</strong>, working on hybrid (on-prem + cloud)
        environments, observability, and automation.

        On this site, you'll find my real-world projects, technical articles,
        and experiments.
